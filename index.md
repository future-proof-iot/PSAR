title: PSAR : Physical Security Applied to (R)IOT
---

## What is PSAR?

PSAR is a research collaboration on IoT cyber-security, embodied as an associated team between Inria TRiBE and FU Berlin.

The high-level goal of PSAR is to complement the cybersecurity mechanisms tackled in the Inria Challenge [RIOT-fp](https://future-proof-iot.github.io/RIOT-fp/about).

PSAR quickly gave birth to -- and was subsumed under -- the french-german research project TinyPART, co-financed by ANR and BMBF. For up-to-date information about the output of this collaboration, please refer to the [TinyPART website](https://tinypart.github.io/TinyPART/).
