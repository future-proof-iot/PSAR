## What is PSAR?

PSAR is a research collaboration on IoT cyber-security between Inria and FU Berlin.
The work planned in PSAR aims to complement the cybersecurity mechanisms tackled in the [RIOT-fp](https://future-proof-iot.github.io/RIOT-fp/about) and the [TinyPART](https://tinypart.github.io/TinyPART/) projects.
