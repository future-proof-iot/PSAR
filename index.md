title: PSAR : Physical Security Applied to (R)IOT
---

## What is PSAR?

PSAR is a research collaboration on cyber-security between Inria and FU Berlin.
The work planned in PSAR aims to complement the cybersecurity mechanisms tackled in [RIOT-fp](https://future-proof-iot.github.io/RIOT-fp/about)
with new schemes exploiting physical characteristics to secure IoT devices, such as Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), physical layer network bootstrapping, and health checks for low-power IoT systems.
